			<br><p> A New Jersey Investment Club... </p>
			<p>We are a <b>local Investment Club</b> based in Maywood, New Jersey with six members and $15,000 in equity. We have been operating out of Bergen County since 2017 and are open to new members. The goal of our club is to educate members on matters of personal finance and general financial literacy while maximizing returns which we do through a buy and hold investment strategy; so far we have <b>profits in excess of $2,000</b>. We meet 12 times a year, on the third Saturday of each month.</p>
			<p>Real Estate is a major interest of our Investment Club as well. As we operate in the TriState area we generally look for properties in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. As of right now, <b>we are saving and looking for properties</b> (generally multi-family, apartment buildings, and AirBNB opportunities) to buy. Our savings goal is 20% of a $500,000 property and we are quickly making progress towards it. If you are interested in joining this Investment Club for our stock or real estate opportunities, please <b>refer to the contact information</b> at the bottom of this page.</p>
